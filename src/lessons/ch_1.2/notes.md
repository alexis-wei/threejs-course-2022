# Lesson 1.2 Notes - Light and Materials

## Textures:
- there is a manager in three to know what's in the area 
- texture can be used as a background, different wrapping can be applied, one to the edge, can mirror and repeat images 
- can offset textures to mock the background moving (i.e in a stop motion sprite)
- currently, semi-transparent objects still have full shadows, is a bug actively being worked on

## Lighting:
- you cannot cast shadows with ambiant lighting
